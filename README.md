# Blockchain Voting App

This is a simple blockchain voting app. It uses a blockchain to store votes and a smart contract to manage the voting process.  

How can I improve this app?
- Add interface for creating new candidates.
- Show a user their vote or voting status
- Show a leaderboard of the top candidates
- Make a more custom UI and design instead of bootstrap
- Add vote delegation
- Add a UI for viewing the blockchain history for the contract
- Write out good "how to use" instructions for viewers of this repo
